## Introduction

This repository is a compilation of projects I have worked on while learning coding through Codecademy. Currently, it contains Python implementations of the Battleship game, a Rock, Paper, Scissors game, and a Unit Converter.

## Projects

### Battleship Game

**Description:**  
This project is a Python implementation of the classic Battleship game. The game allows a player to guess the location of the hidden ships on a grid.

**Key Concepts:**
- Python syntax and indentation
